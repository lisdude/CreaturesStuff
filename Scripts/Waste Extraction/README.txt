Waste Extraction v1.1
---------------------
Prevent 'grazer waste' from accumulating to the point where it causes lag and game crashes.

This script will run roughly every five minutes and try to keep grazer waste down to about 45.
That seems like plenty of waste sitting around, but if you happen to need more for any reason,
please contact me and let me know! I'd love to know why...

================================================================================================

Installation:
1. Copy 'Waste Extraction.cos' into your '\Docking Station\Bootstrap\010 Docking Station' folder.

Existing Worlds or Updating:
2. Press 'CTRL-SHIFT-C' to open the CAOS command line and type: ject "Waste Extraction.cos" 7
3. Press 'CTRL-SHIFT'C' again to close the command line.

================================================================================================

Sharing, Distribution, Archiving, Etc:
Please, feel free to share and archive to your heart's content! All I ask is that you leave this README intact so people know where to find the latest source code.
