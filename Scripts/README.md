This is a collection of scripts and agents I've written for various purposes.

- **AutoMute**: Automatically mute sounds and creature voices each time a world is loaded.
- **Creature Finder**: Type commands to teleport creatures to you in various ways.
- **Signpost Activator**: Automatically add all metarooms to your favorites bar without having to visit each one.
- **Waste Extraction**: Fix an issue where grazer waste would accumulate and lag the game.
- **Wolf Corpse Control**: Add an option to the wolf control dialog to automatically remove corpses. Otherwise they will accumulate, not vanish, the game will think the population limit has been reached, and no new creatures will be born.
- **Maintenance**: Perform maintenance operations to keep worlds snappy.
- **Ecology Monitor**: Re-inject bits of the default ecology as they become extinct / endangered.
- **Debug Dumper**: Periodically dump debug output into a file.
