Top UI Hider v1.0
------------------------
Hides favorite places icons, warp notifications, and life events when you hit CTRL-SHIFT-]

Hit the same key to bring them back.

NOTE: This is intended to be a temporary measure to allow you to click behind the UI elements.
      If new notifications come in while the others are hidden, the new ones will not be hidden.
      If you really want to keep them hidden, you can edit the .cos file to change the line:
      "tick 0" to "tick 20"
      This will enable a 1 second timer to check for new events and hide them.
