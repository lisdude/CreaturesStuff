Wolf Corpse Control v1.2
------------------------
Adds a keyboard shortcut (Shift+Ctrl+O) to the wolf control dialog (Shift+Ctrl+W) to control automatic corpse removal.

NOTE: The corpse cleaning option persists even after the wolf control box is closed. Similar to how the autokill option works.

1. Copy 'DS wolf control.cos' into your '\Docking Station\Bootstrap\010 Docking Station' folder.

Existing Worlds or Updating:
2. Press 'CTRL-SHIFT-C' to open the CAOS command line and type: ject "DS wolf control.cos" 7
3. Press 'CTRL-SHIFT'C' again to close the command line.
