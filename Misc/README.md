## Other Stuff
- `RebuildCreatures1Registry.cmd` deletes existing Creatures 1 registry entries and adds a a minimum set to run the game. It also incorporates the tools fix, so no need to run FixC1Tools.cmd or use the 'Remaster Patch'. Also has an option for the 'doctor' cheat.
- `RebuildCreatures2Registry.cmd` is the same as above. It includes the tool fix, the Blueberry4$ cheat, and setting MaxNorns.
- `RebuildCreatures3Registry.cmd` is the Creatures 3 / Docking Station version of the above.
- `machine.cfg` is a pre-configured machine.cfg for a dual install of Creatures 3 and Docking Station in WINE. Mainly intended for the macOS guide.
- `minicaos` is the official CAOS command line script modified to have a history.
- `FixC1Tools.cmd` enables older tools to find Creatures 1. This is essentially the 'Remaster Patch' without the need for an executable.
- `FixC2Tools.cmd` is the same as above, only for Creatures 2.
- `SetC2Compatibility.cmd` will change the compatibility settings for all Creatures 2 EXE files to use 16-bit color and system DPI scaling.
- `C2Launcher.bat` is a command-line launcher for Creatures 2 worlds. It can be placed anywhere and, when run, presents a menu of detected worlds. Pick one and it launches the game with the world, bypassing passwords entirely. (Useful for when the official launcher breaks and fake passwords your world.)
